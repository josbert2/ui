        ## Tailus principles in action

        Here are a few examples of how the Tailus principles can be applied to building inclusive, custom, appealing, and natural web user interfaces:

        * **Inclusive**: Use high-contrast colors, avoid using text as images, and provide alternative text for all images.
        * **Custom**: Choose your own color schemes, font family, and other preferences.
        * **Appealing**: Use modern design principles and aesthetics, such as white space, clean lines, and bold colors.
        * **Natural**: Use familiar interaction patterns and avoid introducing new concepts that users may not be familiar with.
